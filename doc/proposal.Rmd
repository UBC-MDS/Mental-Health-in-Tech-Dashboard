## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: HR professionals in large companies

Mental health issues can be costly to organizations due to lost productivity, absences and even disability. The World Health Organization estimates that half of all disability worldwide is due to mental health and that 200 million workdays are lost annually due to absenteeism relating to mental health in the United States [@WHO]. Although HR departments implement processes and cultivate workplace culture so as to encourage good mental health, it is often unclear whether these policies do in fact make a difference. If these policy makers could explore which factors are indicators of mental health and what policies are effective in helping employees seek out help, such as providing benefits or providing accessible options, the organization can take a smarter approach to policy implementation. The benefits of reducing mental health could lead to decreased absenteeism, improved employee morale as well providing the organization with a positive reputation for being viewed as a good place to work.

To address these issues, we propose a dashboard which would be used by HR professionals who are in charge of setting HR policy in organizations to visually explore a survey data set of mental health attitudes from tech workers across the globe to identify potential connections that may help with policy setting. The dashboard will allow filtering between responses for those who indicate that they do have a mental health issue versus those that do not and comparing various variables to see how much they may interfere with their work.

## Description of the Data

Our data-set is part of the survey conducted by a non-profit organization named Open Sourcing Mental Illness intended to measure attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. We will be visualizing the data based on the surveys that have been conducted in the year 2014 and from 2016 to 2020 that are available at OSMI [@illness2014a]. The data features collected varies across the years and has columns that contain information related to the respondents(age, gender, country, states, treatment, etc), the respondent's company, and related wellness information(number of employees, remote work, benefits, wellness program, leave, etc) and the viewpoint of the respondent on seeking help and discussing wellness related issues(e.g. Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?)

## Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

### Example Usage Scenario
Mary is a policy maker in HR for a large tech company and she wants to understand what factors affect the mental health of tech workers so that she can create policies that will improve productivity by reducing the likelihood of employees developing mental health conditions that affect their work.

She wants to be able to [explore] a data set in order to [compare] the effect of different variables on the rate at which employees develop mental health conditions that affect their work (called `work_interfere` in the data set) and [identify] the most relevant variables around which to frame her new policies.

When Mary logs on to the "Mental Health in Tech Workers" app, she will see an overview of all the available variables in the data set, according to how each variable affects the `work_interfere` rate.

She can then use her domain expert knowledge to [filter] out variables which would be difficult to craft HR policies around (eg. in Canada an employer cannot make policies which discriminate on the basis of family history of mental illness [@branch_2021], so this variable will probably not be relevant for her usage). She can then [rank] the remaining variables according to metrics like how correlated they are to the `work_interfere` rate. When she does this, Mary may notice that the `seek_help` variable, which corresponds to the survey question "Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?", appears to be strongly negatively correlated to the development of mental health conditions affecting employment. She notes this correlation and hypothesizes that introducing a policy to provide resources for employees seeking help with regards to mental health will reduce the `work_interfere` rate at her company, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study to test this hypothesis.

### Research Questions
From the usage scenario some example research questions we would like our dashboard to be able to answer were identified, including:

Are there notable relationships between variables in the data set? Do these relationships inspire ideas for policy changes among HR domain experts?
What variables correlate most closely to the `work_interfere` variable?
Can the `work_interfere` variable be consistently predicted using a subset of the other variables in the data set? What are the most important variables for doing this?
